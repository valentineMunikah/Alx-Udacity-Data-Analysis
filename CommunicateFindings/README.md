# Ford GoBike System Data Presentation
## by Valentine Munikah


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset has 16 columns and 183412 rows. This presentation aims at looking at the main aspects of bike-sharing in the larger San Francisco Bay area. The major purpose here is to identify the key determinants of trip duration by examining the relationship between trip duration and other explanatory variables in the dataset.
> The aim of this investigation is to identify how different features of the bike system data relate to each other. This investigation seeks to answer the following questions: How does journey duration fluctuate depending on user age, hour, day, and user type? What does the journey duration distribution look like? Which days are the busiest for trips? Which times of day are the most popular for trips?


## Summary of Findings

> From the investigation, I was able to deduce that:
<ol> 
    <li> Users between the age of 20 and 40 have trips whose duration is below 20 minutes. This can be attributed to their busy lifestyles</li>
    <li> Majority of users are females aged 24 years to 35 years.</li>
    <li> More female users are taking up rides as compared to male and other gender. We can also see that a majority of the rides are at 0800 hours and at 1700hours. The least number of rides are between 2300hors and 0500hours. This can be atrributed to people being asleep at these hours.</li>
    <li> Majority of rides are taken at 0800hours and at 1700hours. From this, we can deduce that majority users of the bike sharing system use the service before work and after work. From this graph also depicts that a majority of users who use the bike sharing service are subscribers.</li>
</ol>


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I will focus on adding axis labels on the visualizations. I will only focus on the visualization part of the investigation.
