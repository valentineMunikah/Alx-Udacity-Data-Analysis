    "This presentation aims at looking at the main aspects of bike-sharing in the larger San Francisco Bay area. The major purpose here is to identify the key determinants of trip duration by examining the relationship between trip duration and other explanatory variables in the dataset. We attempt to answer the following questions.\n",
    "How does journey duration fluctuate depending on user age, hour, day, and user type?\n",
